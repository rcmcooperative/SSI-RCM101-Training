## About this Repository

This repository is for the development and deployment of materials by the RCM Cooperative for and on behalf of the [Software Sustainability Institute (SSI)](http://software.ac.uk/). 

## Vision, Mission and Objectives

- **Vision:** Software users and developers leading inclusive, professional and sustainable communities.
- **Mission:** Delivering focused training and fostering collaborative networks that enable Research Software Engineers to excel in building and managing effective research communities.
- **Objectives:**
1. Develop training for online delivery
2. Bring together SSI Fellows interest in RCM

## About

RCM Cooperative were approaced by [SSI](http://software.ac.uk/) to deliver research community management trianing for Fellows, many of which are partially or wholly resonsible for the management of research communities. 

We proposed to develop our existing trianing materials [from November 2024](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14050214), and [July 2025](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15778697) for an online cohort, and additionally include a "clinic" componant.

The development and delivery of materials was funded by SSI Fellow Further Devlopment Fund awards to Malvika Sharan and Emma Karoune (see [this issue](https://github.com/rcmcooperative/SSI-RCM101-Training/issues/2)), with Oscar Siep supprting through advertisement, registration and scheduling of the training. Development and delivery were managed by all via [this issue](https://github.com/rcmcooperative/SSI-RCM101-Training/issues/3).

This repo is the collection of materials prepared for these workshops, contributed to by participants, and a summary of feedback.

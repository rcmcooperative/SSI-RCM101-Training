## 2. Miro Board activities

We will be working collaboratively on a custom Miro board to enable flexible collection and integration of your expertise. 


### Accessing the Miro board

*Figure 1. Miro zoom control on the bottom right of your web browser. Click “+” to zoom in and “-“ to zoom out.*

Initially, we suggest you zoom out so you can see all the “Frames” on the board. 


## 3. Slack**

We will use the RCM Cooperative Slack Workspace for informal conversations between participants before, during and after these workshops. This is a space for you to connect around issues relating to the management of research communities.

You will have a private channel for participants in this workshop (#ssi-rcm101), and access to the other public channels in the workspace.

If you are not familiar with using Slack, you may find this [Quick Start Guide from The Turing Way](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/communication-channels/slack-start-guide) helpful.

### What to expect from the Community Clinics?

* Please bring a **critical situation/problem from your community** or a **specific implementation of RCM approaches** that is/was particularly challenging for you to deal with in your project. 
* We as a team will diagnose the issue, share insights and identify **some potential next steps/solutions**. 
* If you have already identified a solution, please don't write it down; you will have an opportunity to share that at the end of the clinic. 
* We will** +1 the issue we want to discuss first**, which would mean that we may use our next clinic to discuss some challenges that we can't get through at this meeting.
* Before the clinic session, please add your notes in the shared document under these prompts:
    * *Community-related challenge that I am currently encountering in my project*
    * *What are the indicators that this issue is particularly challenging?*
    * *Who in your project is involved in addressing it?*
    * *How does solving this issue affect your community?*

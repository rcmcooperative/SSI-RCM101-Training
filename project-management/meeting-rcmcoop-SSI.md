- Emma Karoune (RCM Co-op)
- Oscar Seip (SSI)

## Notes
- Oscar saw our posts about AIUK RCM101 training, and though it looked interesting!
    - Piza, A., Karoune, E., Sharan, M., Bennett, A., Araujo Alvarez, A., & Gould van Praag, C. (2025, March 17). Driving innovation and impact with research community building. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15006451
- SSI is having some training of mentors
- Keen to run some cohort-based training for fellows
    - RCM
    - Community building
    - Community practice
        - This is a point of difference of SSI fellowship cf other fellowships
- Where RCM Coop sits?
    - SSI is supporting OLS 
    - Interest from SSI to also support activities and groups
- RCM Coop involves members who are active in and responsible for strategic development of OLS and TTW.
    - Looking to create a space where we can continue to do this valuable work
    - High demand for these types of skills, but not a lot of training/support for structured delivery of RCM 
        - We have a lot to offer in this space
    - At some point, we should be looking for joint funding to build a community for communities!
        - There are organisations for everyone, but there isn't one for us!
        - Intentionally a "co-operative" to define the power dynamics
- Activities RCM Coop are envisioning for 5-10y?
    - Training (short and cohort)
    - Conviening
    - Consultancy (Training, facilitation, research)
    - [Tool development](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gzf80byNK0xBvmZVadRC3imnN8VJK49S/view?usp=sharing)
    - Professionalisation
- SSI most interested in Training
    - Co-op could become official partner
    - Would get us into the conversations about professionalisation
- Tool
    - Oscar is deputy product manager of [Low Fat](https://github.com/softwaresaved/lowfat)
        - Could be other features developed around it 
        - Consultancy about setting up fellowship programmes
            - SSI happy to have feedback and outside perspectives on how their fellowship programme runs
            - Worked with OLS on the mentorship programme
            - Restructuring around cohort based learning
- SSI sometimes gets request for landscape studies etc. But don't always ahve the resource
- Want to make sure the thoughts from the community are getting fedback to funders
- A lot of overlap in our community members - would be good to coordinate that
- UKRI understands that theu are funding a lot of work in community, but the communinty activites are not always delivered to the highest standard
    - Emma in conversations with UKRI about this
    - We should expect people to have community management training, especially if there are community deliverables. 
- A lot of SSI applications are around building CoPs. 
    - A lot of learning by doing
    - SSI is a nice place to come in and share expereinces
    - There are a lot of structured and generalisable opportunities
- CSCCE
    - There is potential and opportunity to have multiple players in this space
    - Differentiated geographically (UK Funders might prefer a UK/EU ecosystem)
    - We are open by design and more data science focused (e.g. github)
    - They are diversifying training, e.g. project management
    - We have good reach into LMICs
        - Investing back into the community
        - May be an opportunity for scalable training rather than commercial
    - Our intentional stance around Co-Op
- What next
    - Training is the first space we can start
    - Cohort or single session
    - Limitation is budget
    - Something smaller would be easier to find space for
    - Really keen to develope something bigger that we can bolt on into the fellowship progamme
        - Would need to find new funding for this
            - ==Look at funding opportunities and develop a grant together==
        - Clear argument and project to propose
            - Up to May 2028 (SSI4 phase)
                - Flexibility in fellowship budget, could look for internal pots to expand it, or reprioritise budget
                - Likely not enough for a larger cohort training
            - for SSI5 build in a larger componant for RCM training in fellowship programme
    - up to £1500 per fellow at the moment that we can apply for activities beyond their inaugoral year (Emma and Malvika could both apply to lead a sesison each)
    - £3-5k would need to do more work on the budget and clearly communicate value proposition to the team
    - £5-10k would need to find more bolt on funding
    - ELIXIR might have some training grants in their budget
    - a lot of SSI staff getting involved in the Network+ grants
        - Could deliver things under these which are open to fellows.
- ==Co-Op actions==
    - What can we do for 2 x £1500 (modular, e.g. one module on event management) via Further Development Fund
        - Cass suggests we need some survey / data on what people would want most
        - Could be formal or informal (e.g. slack poll)
            - Formal data would also be good
        - Fellowship mentor programme applications could be a good source
        - They have a community building study group
            - Email list
            - News letters
            - ==101 would probably be a good space to start==
    - Then what could we do for £3-5k
- Further development fund call opens e.o. May. Also ad hoc (ok to come in a bit later)
    - Need to think about where and when it could happen
        - 101 could be June/July
        - Online

## Activity 1: Research Community Management (RCM) 101 - Part 1: Understanding the RCM role

### Applicant

- Name: Emma Karoune
- SSI Fellowship Year: 2021
- Email address: [ekaroune@turing.ac.uk](mailto:ekaroune@turing.ac.uk)

### Description

*Provide goals, expected outcomes, and how it will contribute to your professional development and the SSI or broader research software community.*

We propose to design and deliver the first part of the two-part workshop “Research Community Manager 101” (RCM101). This 2-hour introductory workshop covers the fundamental concepts of Research community management and stakeholder mapping for attendees’ own communities. This workshop, RCM101, will be offered by RCM Cooperative, newly cofounded by Cassandra Gould van Praag and two SSI Fellows, Malvika Sharan and Emma Karoune. In a separate application, Malvika Sharan has proposed to deliver the second part of this workshop.

The training workshop will be followed up with a 1-hour Community Clinic session, where SSI Fellows who have attended the workshop can bring their specific community management challenge to discuss with the RCM Cooperative founders and other SSI Fellow attendees.

### Goal and Expected Outcome

Whether taking community management responsibilities in a formal or informal capacity, this workshop aims to build a fundamental understanding of research community management skills and opportunities. The first of the RCM101 will introduce fellows to the fundamental concepts of community management, then delve into two main modules: 1) RCM skills and competencies and 2) stakeholder mapping. 

The workshop will be a condensed, interactive 2-hour session aimed at sharing conceptual knowledge and practical frameworks that can help community facilitators and managers implement practices in setting up their community and getting started with their community-building journey. We will provide an RCM skills and competency framework, allowing participants to assess their skills as community managers, and map people, processes and resources in their communities to enable community engagement.

This workshop will be based on our collaborative co-authored research article ([https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2409.00108](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2409.00108)) and will allow piloting of the training curriculum under development by the RCM Cooperative for community managers.

Reflection and peer discussion will be key elements of the format. All participants will leave the workshop with key messages from the two modules, additional resources and connections with other attendees, helping them continue their learning as community managers.

All materials and delivery methods will be openly documented and made openly available to enable future referencing, reuse and adaptation both by the attendees and through the RCM Cooperative’s communication platforms.

We will follow up the workshop with a 60-minute Community Clinic session a week after the training workshop to allow attendees to revisit workshop materials in the context of their own projects. Attendees will be able to bring community management questions to this session to discuss with peers and get support from the RCM Cooperative team members to identify solutions.

### Professional Development

As a fellow, this activity will support my professional development and allow me to connect with SSI Fellows from different years. It has the potential to enable new collaborations between my existing community work, such as at the Turing Institute and HiddenRef,  and the work of other Fellows. 

It will also increase the visibility of the RCM Cooperative and help me build experience as a community consultant. Based on my experience as an open science practitioner, community facilitator and technical trainer, this workshop will allow the RCM Cooperative to demonstrate community pedagogy, curriculum co-creation, and community leadership.

This workshop will also serve to connect learners with community experts, fellow community managers and the Cooperative’s broader goal of strengthening community management as a professional identity. Following the strong example of the Research Software Engineering movement, this initiative will provide a clearer pathway for researchers into the profession of research community management.  By building a shared understanding and value for community management and connecting research community managers across disciplines, we aim to develop a rich and connected field of community management.


## Activity 2: Research Community Management (RCM) 101 - Part 2: RCM Strategy

### Applicant

- Name: Malvika Sharan
- SSI Fellowship Year: 2019
- Email address: [malvikasharan@gmail.com](mailto:malvikasharan@gmail.com) 

### Activity description

*Provide goals, expected outcomes, and how it will contribute to your professional development and the SSI or broader research software community.*

We propose to design and deliver the second part of the two-part workshop “Research Community Manager 101 ” (RCM101). This 2-hour session will cover the topics to get attendees started on building their community management strategies. We will guide attendees to understand the maturity levels of their community and how they can build an effective engagement strategy. This workshop, RCM101, will be offered by RCM Cooperative, newly cofounded by Cassandra Gould van Praag and two SSI Fellows, Malvika Sharan and Emma Karoune. In a separate application, Emma Karoune has proposed to deliver the first part of this workshop.

The training workshop will be followed up with a 1-hour Community Clinic session, where SSI Fellows who have attended the workshop can bring their specific community management challenge to discuss with the RCM Cooperative founders and other SSI Fellow attendees.

### Goal and Expected Outcome

Building on the fundamental concepts of community management skills and initial concepts introduced in part 1 of the RCM101, we will guide fellows to build strategies for managing their communities. This second part will introduce fellows to two subsequent modules: 1) stakeholder engagement, and 2) the community participation process.

The workshop will be a condensed, interactive 2-hour session aimed at sharing conceptual knowledge and practical frameworks that can help community facilitators and managers take their community management skills to the next level. We will discuss different levels of participation and how that affects the community engagement approaches from consultation to collaboration to networked leadership, each informing strategies for different stages of community building. 

This workshop will be based on our collaborative co-authored research article ([https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2409.00108](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2409.00108)) and will allow piloting of the training curriculum under development by the RCM Cooperative for community managers.

Attendees will be able to bring community management questions to this session to discuss with peers and get support from the RCM Cooperative team members to identify solutions.

### Professional Development

As a fellow, this activity will support my professional development and allow me to connect with SSI Fellows from different years. It has the potential to enable new collaborations between my existing community work, such as in OLS and The Turing way, and the work of other Fellows. 

It will also increase the visibility of the RCM Cooperative and help me support my team members build experience as a community consultant. Based on my experience as an open science practitioner, community facilitator and technical trainer, this workshop will allow the RCM Cooperative to demonstrate community pedagogy, curriculum co-creation, and community leadership. This workshop will also serve to connect learners with community experts, fellow community managers and the Cooperative’s broader goal of strengthening community management as a professional identity. Following the strong example of the Research Software Engineering movement, this initiative will provide a clearer pathway for researchers into the profession of research community management.

## How do you plan to share the outcomes of these activities with the SSI and broader research software community?

To understand the impact of this workshop, we will implement pre- and post-workshop surveys. These surveys will be important for capturing participants' initial expectations, adjusting materials and communicating the scope of the workshop, and measuring the tangible outcomes.

Following the workshop, a blog post for the SSI website will be drafted to highlight key takeaways and successes. For a more in-depth report, a narrative format debrief document will be created, summarising insights gathered from the survey data, listing the training resources developed and used, and the future scope for both the learners and RCM Cooperative.

We will embed transparency and accessibility across all aspects of the workshop. The workshop planning, resource development, workshop delivery, and resource archiving will be facilitated through an open GitHub repository (utilising issue, Pull Request and review features). All workshop materials will be shared on Zenodo for broad reuse, ensuring that our resources are readily available to the wider community beyond the workshop.
